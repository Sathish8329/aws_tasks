AWS EFS Setup and Automatic Mounting Guide
Step 1: Create a Security Group for EFS
Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
Create a Security Group:
Go to Security Groups under Network & Security.
Click Create Security Group.
Name: EFS
Description: Security group for EFS access
Inbound Rules:
Type: NFS
Protocol: TCP
Port Range: 2049
Source: Select Custom and choose the security group associated with your EC2 instance or enter the instance IP.
Click Create Security Group.
Step 2: Create an EFS File System
Navigate to the AWS EFS Console:
Go to EFS under Storage.
Create EFS:
Click Create file system.
Name: Enter a name such as tooplate-image.
Customize: Keep the default settings or adjust as needed.
Network:
Select the VPC where your EC2 instance resides.
Security Group: Choose the EFS security group created in Step 1.
Click Next and then Create.
Step 3: Create an Access Point for EFS
Access Points:
In the EFS console, click Access Points on the left sidebar.
Click Create Access Point.
Select EFS: Choose the EFS file system created in Step 2.
Scroll down and click Create Access Point.
Step 4: Install EFS Utilities on the EC2 Instance
For Amazon Linux:

bash
Copy code
sudo yum install -y amazon-efs-utils
For Debian-Based Distributions (like Ubuntu):

bash
Copy code
# Update package list and install dependencies
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y install git binutils rustc cargo pkg-config libssl-dev

# Clone the EFS utilities repository
git clone https://github.com/aws/efs-utils

# Build and install the EFS utilities
cd efs-utils
./build-deb.sh
sudo apt-get -y install ./build/amazon-efs-utils*deb
Step 5: Configure Automatic Mounting
Backup Existing Data:

bash
Copy code
mkdir /tmp/image_backup
mv /var/www/html/image/* /tmp/image_backup
Update /etc/fstab for Automatic Mounting:

Open the /etc/fstab file:
bash
Copy code
sudo vi /etc/fstab
Add the EFS mount entry:
css
Copy code
fs-0fe37d28145c4f15e /var/www/html/img efs _netdev,tls,accesspoint=fsap-09d69acff7111add9 0 0
Save and exit the editor (press Esc, type :wq, and press Enter).
Mount the EFS:

bash
Copy code
sudo mount -fav
Expected Output:
bash
Copy code
/                        : ignored
/boot                    : already mounted
/boot/efi                : already mounted
mount: (hint) your fstab has been modified, but systemd still uses
       the old version; use 'systemctl daemon-reload' to reload.
/var/www/html/images     : successfully mounted
Verify the Mount:

bash
Copy code
df -h
Ensure that /var/www/html/images is listed and correctly mounted.
Troubleshooting
Security Group Errors: If the mount fails, verify that the security group associated with the EFS allows NFS traffic from your EC2 instance.
Systemd Daemon Reload: If you receive a hint to reload systemd, run:
bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
This guide ensures a secure and efficient setup for mounting AWS EFS using an access point, including preparation, configuration, and verification steps.
