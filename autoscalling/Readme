AWS Auto Scaling is a service that automatically adjusts the number of Amazon EC2 instances in a group according to the demand, ensuring your applications have the right amount of resources available to handle the current load. It helps maintain application performance and availability while optimizing costs.

Key Components of AWS Auto Scaling
Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs):

Definition: A collection of EC2 instances that are managed as a group. An Auto Scaling group allows you to scale your instance count up or down based on defined policies.
Configuration: Includes settings for the minimum and maximum number of instances, desired capacity, and scaling policies.
Scaling Policies:

Dynamic Scaling: Automatically adjusts the number of instances based on metrics such as CPU utilization or network traffic.
Scheduled Scaling: Adjusts the number of instances based on a scheduled time, useful for predictable changes in demand.
Launch Configurations / Launch Templates:

Launch Configuration: Defines the configuration of EC2 instances that the Auto Scaling group will use, including instance type, AMI, and key pairs.
Launch Template: A more flexible way to define instance configurations, supporting versioning and additional features.
Scaling Metrics:

Metrics from Amazon CloudWatch (e.g., CPU utilization, disk I/O) are used to trigger scaling actions based on predefined thresholds.
Scaling Actions:

Actions are taken based on the scaling policies. For example, adding or removing instances from the ASG to match the current demand.
