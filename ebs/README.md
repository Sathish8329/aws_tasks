Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) is a scalable, high-performance block storage service designed for use with Amazon EC2 instances. EBS provides persistent storage volumes that can be attached to EC2 instances, allowing data to be retained even after the instance is stopped or terminated.

Key Features of AWS EBS:
Persistent Storage: EBS volumes are durable and retain data independently of the life of an EC2 instance.

Types of Volumes:

General Purpose SSD (gp3/gp2): Balanced price and performance for a wide range of workloads.
Provisioned IOPS SSD (io2/io1): High-performance volumes for latency-sensitive applications.
Throughput Optimized HDD (st1): Low-cost storage for large, sequential data access.
Cold HDD (sc1): Lowest-cost storage designed for infrequently accessed data.
Snapshots: You can create point-in-time backups of EBS volumes called snapshots, which are stored in Amazon S3 and can be used to create new EBS volumes.

Encryption: EBS supports encryption at rest using AWS-managed or customer-managed keys.

Resizing and Optimization: EBS volumes can be resized, and volume types can be changed without downtime.

Availability: EBS volumes are designed for 99.999% availability and are automatically replicated within their Availability Zone.

Performance: EBS provides consistent performance, with options to optimize for high IOPS or throughput.

Attachment: EBS volumes can be attached to a single EC2 instance or shared across multiple instances (with Amazon EFS).

Use Cases:
Database Storage: Storing databases that require consistent IOPS and low latency.
Backup and Recovery: Using snapshots for disaster recovery and data backup.
Big Data Analytics: High throughput volumes for big data and log processing.
EBS is a versatile and essential component of the AWS infrastructure, offering flexible and reliable storage options for various applications and workloads.
