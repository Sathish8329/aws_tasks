How to Create and Permanently Mount an EBS Volume on an EC2 Instance
Mounting an Elastic Block Store (EBS) volume on an EC2 instance is essential for extending storage, backing up data, or improving performance. In this guide, we'll walk through the process of creating an EBS volume, attaching it to an EC2 instance, partitioning it, formatting it, and mounting it permanently.

Step 1: Create an EBS Volume
Navigate to the AWS Management Console:

Open the EC2 Dashboard and select "Volumes" under the "Elastic Block Store" section.
Create a New Volume:

Click on "Create Volume".
Select the Size: Choose the required volume size (e.g., 10 GiB).
Availability Zone: Ensure you select the same availability zone as your EC2 instance's root volume.
Tagging: Assign a meaningful tag, e.g., Name=Matomo-Data-Volume, to easily identify the volume.
Attach the Volume to the EC2 Instance:

Once created, select the Volume ID of the new volume.
Click on "Actions" and choose "Attach Volume".
Instance Selection: Choose your target EC2 instance from the list and attach the volume.
Step 2: Connect to the EC2 Instance and Prepare the Volume
SSH into Your EC2 Instance:

Use SSH to connect to your EC2 instance.
Run the following command to update the package list:
bash
Copy code
sudo apt update
List All Disks:

Check the disks and their partitions using fdisk:
bash
Copy code
sudo fdisk -l
Identify the newly attached disk (it will likely be listed as /dev/xvdf or similar) with no partitions.
Step 3: Partition the New Disk
Start Partitioning:

Begin partitioning the new disk:
bash
Copy code
sudo fdisk /dev/xvdf
You will be prompted with options. Use the following commands:
m: Display help.
n: Create a new partition.
p: Select a primary partition.
1: Choose partition number 1.
Enter: Accept the default values to use the entire disk size or specify a size (e.g., +7G).
w: Write changes and exit.
Verify the Partition:

List all partitions again to confirm:
bash
Copy code
sudo fdisk -l
The new partition will appear as /dev/xvdf1.
Step 4: Format the Partition
Select a Filesystem:
You can format the partition with a suitable filesystem like ext4 or xfs.
bash
Copy code
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/xvdf1
This command will create an ext4 filesystem on the partition.
Step 5: Mount the Volume
Backup Existing Data:

Before mounting, create a backup directory and move any existing data:
bash
Copy code
mkdir /tmp/matomo-backup
mv /root/matomo/* /tmp/matomo-backup/
Temporary Mount:

Temporarily mount the new volume:
bash
Copy code
sudo mount /dev/xvdf1 /root/matomo/
Verify the mount with:
bash
Copy code
df -h
Permanent Mount:

Unmount the temporary mount:
bash
Copy code
sudo umount /dev/xvdf1
Open the /etc/fstab file to configure the permanent mount:
bash
Copy code
sudo vi /etc/fstab
Add the following line at the end of the file:
bash
Copy code
/dev/xvdf1  /root/matomo/  ext4  defaults  0  0
Save and exit the editor (:wq).
Mount as per fstab:

Mount all filesystems as defined in /etc/fstab:
bash
Copy code
sudo mount -a
Confirm the mount:
bash
Copy code
df -h
And thatâ€™s it! Your EBS volume is now permanently mounted to your EC2 instance, ensuring it remains attached even after a reboot.
