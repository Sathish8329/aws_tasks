Create an AMI (Amazon Machine Image) from an EC2 Instance:

Go to your EC2 instance.
Click on "Actions," then "Image and templates," and choose "Create image."
Provide a name and tag for your image, then click "Create image."
The AMI can be used to launch instances in different regions, share with other AWS accounts, or serve as a backup.
Launch an Instance Using the AMI:

You can either launch a new instance directly from the AMI or create a launch template for easier future use.
To create a launch template, go to "Launch template," select "Create template," choose the AMI, give it a name and tag, and click "Create template."
To launch an instance from the template, select the template, click "Launch instance from template," make any necessary configuration changes, and remember to update the tag for easy identification.
Set Up a Target Group:

Go to the Load Balancers section and create a target group. A target group is a collection of instances that will receive traffic.
Select "Instance" as the target type, give your target group a name, and set it to use HTTP on port 80.
Configure health check settings and select the VPC where your instances are located.
Add the instances you want to include in the target group.
Create an Application Load Balancer (ALB):

Go to the Load Balancer section and select "Create load balancer," then choose "Application Load Balancer."
Name your load balancer, create a security group, and select all availability zones (AZs).
Set the listener port to 80 and associate it with the target group you just created.
After creating the load balancer, ensure your instance's security group allows traffic on port 80 from the load balancer's security group.
Access the Website via Load Balancer:

You can now access your website using the DNS name provided by the load balancer.
Cleanup Process:

To clean up, delete the load balancer first, then the target group, and finally the instances.
