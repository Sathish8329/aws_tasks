Step 1: Create an S3 Bucket
Login to AWS Management Console:

Navigate to the AWS Management Console.
Open S3 Service:

In the search bar, type “S3” and select it from the drop-down list.
Create a New Bucket:

Click on the “Create bucket” button.
Configure Bucket Settings:

Bucket Name: Enter a unique name for your bucket. Bucket names must be globally unique across all AWS accounts.
Region: Choose the AWS region where you want to create the bucket.
Object Ownership: By default, the ACLs (Access Control Lists) will be disabled to prevent public access. You can enable ACLs later if needed.
Block Public Access Settings: Leave this enabled for now to prevent public access to the bucket and its objects by default.
Bucket Versioning: Enable versioning to keep multiple versions of an object in the bucket. This helps recover from accidental deletions or overwrites.
Configure Bucket Properties:

Storage Class: By default, the storage class will be set to "S3 Standard." You can change this based on your needs (e.g., S3 Intelligent-Tiering, S3 Standard-IA, etc.).
Create Bucket:

Click on the “Create bucket” button at the bottom of the page. Your bucket will be created.
Step 2: Upload Files to the Bucket
Open the Bucket:

Click on your newly created bucket to open it.
Upload Objects:

Click on the “Upload” button.
Drag and drop files or folders from your desktop, or click “Add files” to select files from your computer.
Click “Upload” to add the files to your bucket.
Step 3: Explore Bucket and Object Options
Bucket Overview: Explore various options like properties, permissions, and management settings available for the bucket.
Object Properties: Click on an object and view its properties, metadata, and permissions. The “Object URL” displayed here is the public DNS of the object, but it won't be accessible publicly yet.
Step 4: Make an Object Public Using ACL
Enable ACL for the Object:

Select the object you want to make public.
Go to the “Permissions” tab.
Under “Object Ownership,” click “Edit.”
Enable “ACL (Access Control List)” by acknowledging and saving changes.
Make Object Public:

Select the object, click “Actions” in the top-right corner, and scroll down to “Make public using ACL.”
If the option fails, proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: Adjust Bucket Permissions for Public Access
Edit Bucket Permissions:

Go back to the main bucket page and click on the “Permissions” tab.
Under “Block Public Access,” click “Edit.”
Uncheck the settings that block public access (e.g., “Block all public access”).
Save changes and confirm the prompt.
Retry Making the Object Public:

Now that the bucket allows public access, go back to the object, select it, and make it public using ACL again.
Step 6: Access the Object Publicly
Once the object is made public using ACL, you can access it using the “Object URL” from the properties section. Enter the URL in your browser to view the object.
Note:
Even after enabling public access at the bucket level, you must make each object public individually using ACL. Every newly added object will require this step to be accessible publicly.
This process provides a controlled way of making specific objects in your S3 bucket publicly accessible while keeping the rest private.
