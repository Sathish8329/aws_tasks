Title: Hosting a Static Website on AWS S3 with Versioning, Access Logs, and Lifecycle Management
Introduction
Overview: Highlighting the ease and cost-effectiveness of hosting static websites on Amazon S3.
Prerequisites: An AWS account and basic knowledge of S3.
Step 1: Downloading the Source Code
Selecting a Template: Go to Tooplate.com, choose a website template, and download the source code.
Unzipping the File: Extract the downloaded ZIP file to your local machine.
Step 2: Creating S3 Buckets
Create the Main Bucket:
Name: toobarista (Bucket names must be globally unique).
Versioning: Enable versioning to protect against accidental deletions and to keep track of file changes.
Upload Files: Upload the unzipped files to this bucket.
Create the Logging Bucket:
Name: toobarista-logs.
Purpose: Store server access logs for tracking and auditing.
Step 3: Making Objects Public
Enable Public Access:
ACL Settings: Enable ACL and disable the "Block all public access" setting.
Make Objects Public: Select all objects, choose Actions, scroll down, and make them public using ACL.
Verify Public Access:
Access URL: Check the object URLs to ensure they are publicly accessible.
Step 4: Setting Up Static Website Hosting
Enable Static Website Hosting:
Properties: Go to the Properties tab in the main bucket.
Configuration: Scroll down to Static website hosting, enable it, and specify index.html and error.html (even if you don't have an error.html file).
Access URL: Get the website URL provided by AWS.
Step 5: Enabling Server Access Logs
Enable Access Logs:
Properties: In the main bucket, scroll to Server access logging.
Configuration: Enable it and select the toobarista-logs bucket as the destination.
Step 6: Understanding and Using Versioning
Enable and Use Versioning:
Show Versions: Enable the "Show versions" option to see all versions of your files.
Restore or Delete Versions: Learn how to restore previous versions or delete specific versions permanently.
Overwrite Files: Upload a new version of a file (e.g., index.html) and see how it appears.
Step 7: Managing S3 Lifecycle Policies
Create a Lifecycle Rule:
Rule Name: costeffective.
Apply to All Objects: Set rules for both versioned and non-versioned objects.
Storage Class Transitions: Transition from Standard to IA, Glacier, and Deep Glacier based on the age of the objects.
Expiration: Set expiration dates for old objects to save costs.
Incomplete Uploads: Set rules to clean up incomplete multipart uploads after a specific period.
Step 8: Disaster Recovery with S3 Replication
Set Up Cross-Region Replication:
Destination Bucket: Create a new bucket in another region.
Replication Rule: Set up replication to the destination bucket, enabling versioning in both buckets.
IAM Role: Create the necessary IAM role for replication.
Choose Storage Class: Opt for a cost-effective storage class like OneZone-IA in the destination bucket.
Conclusion
Review: Summarize the steps, emphasizing the benefits of using S3 for hosting static websites with features like versioning, access logs, lifecycle management, and disaster recovery.
Next Steps: Encourage readers to explore more advanced features of AWS S3 and consider using CloudFront for CDN integration.
